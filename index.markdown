**Tyson Mote** is a Senior Principal Software Engineer at [Twilio Segment](https://segment.com/). He was born in Montana and he raised and [sold pigs at the county fair](https://eldoradocountyfair.org/livestock.html) to buy his [first computer](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ibook/specs/ibook_se.html), but he's more of a city person these days. He lives in Portland, Oregon and has a wife and son that he likes very much.

He'd like to visit Iceland someday; it sounds nice.

You can email him at [tyson@bufio.net](mailto:tyson@bufio.net).
